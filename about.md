Traditional implementations of scrum have run their course. Sadly more frequently than not what's left is the wrote practice basic meeting archetypes and agendas without a core understanding and demonstratable value behind them. The evidence for this is shown in several ways. Firstly we have the diminished role of the scrum master. Most scrum masters have been reduced to glorified meeting facilitators. Secondly, we have the evidence that most organizations are not using scrum is defined by the scrum guide. Thirdly and lastly, we have the popularity of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) which in some ways builds off of Scrum but in other ways contradicts it. We believe we can do better and we have developed and are continuing to develop strategies and a new system that supports agile core values fitted for the 21st century. 

## The Next Evolution of Agile

A la cart design. If it doesn't apply, let it fly. What our component-based approach we don't require a full sell acceptance or application of everything that we promote. Each component is intended to be a tool in the toolbox that can be leveraged if teams find the useful. Our system is also not a consultant base system. The starting point of implementing it is not to hire a host of transformation specialists. Our system is more akin to a development technology they can be used by professionals if there is a fit. You don't need to employ a team from amazon to begin using AWS services. Looked at in this way the dragon agility group promotes something more akin to DevOps process engineering rather than a branded agile methodology. 

**System-Level Design**

Any local optimization will be suboptimal for a system as a whole. Nights basic systems theory. So if one is talking about large-scale software delivery meaning the coordinated release of software between multiple teams one has to talk about things at a systems level and that's above the team level. The most popular sailing approach safe tries to do this with the program increment, release trains, and an emphasis on business value. There are some real problems with these because the program increment contradicts the atomic value that the single increment is supposed to provide, the Release Train contradicts the supposed autonomy that the individual teams are supposed to possess, and the emphasis on business value is typically not within the sphere of controllable things for an individual software team. Our first agenda is to perfect the delivery side of software agility. If the business has the wherewithal to select features let do in fact bring measurable value to end-users then that's great but the engineering team who typically has no say on what those features are should not be occupying itself with those concerns. Doing so invariably results in confusion of roles responsibilities and frustration. 

**Learning-Centered**

**Document Driven**

**Remote Native**

The benefits of distributed remote teams outweigh the benefits of collocation. Full stop. There we said it. Feel free to throw tomatoes. But that's the funny part. Very few engineers's on teams actually want collocation. The only people crying out for collocation are the theorist not actually doing the work. And we're married to a system that is obsessed with collocation. Until we not just get comfortable with but completely embrace organizational decentralisation we will not be able to capitalize on its benefits. 

**Data-Based**

Show me the numbers. (Yelled Jerry McGruir style). We recently spent two weeks interviewing new agilist candidates for a new position we were trying to fill. The questions we ask them was "what makes an effective team?". We receive many answers. Good communication, collaboration, teamwork, etc. What's interesting is not a single person said anything about how successful they were in accomplishing the goals of the team. The efficiency sustainability or predictability of their software process wasn't on the radar and any of these answers. This leads me to ask "what would you say if I told you that such and such team was the best team in the NFL but didn't win any games?". We can do better than this. The dragon agility group is dedicated to empirical, demonstratable, and measurable metrics of the key features of effective software delivery. 

**Tools & Automation**

One doesn't scale software delivery with more meetings or more carefully crafted meeting agendas. These may help but they will only get you so far. An analogy could be drawn in the same way to source control. If you had a group of software teams not using Source control, they may be able to do a little bit better with some carefully crafted meetings and agendas, but those things alone cannot make up for the lack of basic tooling and Technical processes. In a similar vein, many of the scaled agile approaches propose that software delivery can be scaled by patterns of human interactions when in fact some scaling is only possible with very specific technological prerequisites and tooling implementations.

**Program Agilists**

aka The Scrum Master is dead. Long live the program Agilist.

1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4.  Responding to change over following a plan.
