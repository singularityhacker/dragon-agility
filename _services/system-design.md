The goal of the Dragon agility group is to optimize large-scale software delivery at the system level. Now you might think that this means did anything below that suffer some consequences but not being the highest priority but we strongly feel that is a systems-level design that doesn't contradict the values and goals of individual teams is absolutely essential right now. Many Advil scaling systems violate the values in the goals of individual teams in their prescribed patterns at the system level. What is needed is a pattern and a solution that holds true and doesn't contradict itself when applied fractally and recursively to each level of the program.

# Software Delivery System Design

So what exactly do we mean when we say system design?

1.  For starters we mean a basic diagram displays how work enters, is processed, and exits your system or organization. This is your model. By making it explicit, we allow our ourselves the freedom and clarity to self augment. 
2.  Secondly, we need data associated with every major transition in that system. That is, events that fire as the system runs giving us objective metrics on how fast if active and predictable and consistent that system is. These will be invaluable because as we make changes we need to know how they're affecting things.
3.  Leslie, we need levers. Levers are specific actions and modifications that can be made that have an established correlating relationship with key metrics.

Set a put all this together, number one gives us the frame, number to gives us the dashboard, and number three gives us the controls. Now that's not to say that these three don't change. These three will certainly be changing a lot with time. That's the whole point of having them explicit and establish and functional is that there's a starting point for evolution refinement and improvement. 

By applying principles of systems modeling in the theory of constraints, we're able to thoroughly map your organization's system of delivery. And you may say to yourself, why do we need this we're getting stuff done everything seems to be okay. But that kind of misses the point because you don't know what you're capable of. Only after having a rigorous map, Rich data generation, and effective levers, are you able to clearly see and be empowered to make decisions regarding optimization. This may mean adding key resources are making changes to certain workflows enabling tremendous growth in your throughput. This may also mean removing things and dramatically reducing costs with the same throughput. The secret is this: the end goal is the feedback loop. If there is no feedback loop, the continued health of your organization is almost a matter of chance.
