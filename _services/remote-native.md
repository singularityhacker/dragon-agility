Up to this point, almost all interpretations of the agile Manifesto endorse collocation as the only prescribed method of Team organization. Notice I said interpretations. That's because we don't dispute the exact wording of the six principal the agile Manifesto which is: 

"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.‚Äù

What we do dispute is it it's necessary to be co-located to engage in maximally effective face-to-face conversation. Things have changed a lot since 2007. And far from being a disadvantage or even in neutral point the advantages a remote organization has come to so far outweigh the insistence on co-location that we feel it's a crime to not leverage them.

## Talent Pool

More talent.

## Commute and Work-Life Ballance

Better balance.

## Speed

Faster delivery. By organizing into time-shifted teams, an organization has the ability to dramatically increase its productivity and rate of delivery.
