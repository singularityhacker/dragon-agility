If the model of an organization's software delivery is the code of that org, what follows is the documentation. It's what new members can pick up on the first day, read in one sitting, ngrok the mechanics of your organization. Just like the model, it's subject to change as the organization changes, but just like the model it's important to have it explicitly stated because it acts as a starting point for recursive self-improvement.

## Your Own "Scrum Guide"

No two organizations of the same. No two organizations will have the same values, roles, workflow, or personalities. Why then do we try to apply generic documents do widely diverse groups in such a way that ignores or disregards their distinct characteristics? Creating your own agility handbook provides an opportunity to capture in natural language how your organization works, the number and function of the different roles, and how different entities relate and interact to produce value. It also acts as a critical change agent because as the organization changes those changes make their way back into the agility handbook which then gets repropagated throughout the organization.

## Case Study: MyUPMC

At the beginning of the 2020 global pandemic, the MyUPMC software group faced a trifecta of sudden change:

1.  Our whole department was sent home. While we suspected this would happen as many other businesses were doing so, it still meant rethinking our communication and collaboration methods. The increased digital communication increased the possibility of communication overhead overload as our slack channels begin to reproduce ad infinitum. We came to increasingly find that the value of documentation and written communication couldn't be overstated.
2.  We just received a new budget with the expectation that we would be doubling in size. That meant onboarding people and organizing our teams without seeing each other face-to-face or interacting through typical conversation. And are doubling in size meant that we needed a more planned out comprehensive onboarding strategy and orientation than had previously existed.
3.  As a major healthcare application, we needed to respond to the sudden spike of customer requests related to COVID-19 testing, which meant a succession of expedited production releases. So we needed to move faster—this drive to deliver faster increased the danger of introducing bugs.

For all of the above reasons, significant changes needed to happen in our processes and procedures. In the past, we got by having some meetings and conversations and going for walks one-on-one with folks to socialize ideas and settle on changes over time, but that whole dynamic was going to be different now. 

Suddenly the need for a canonical written source of process and procedures became evident. We needed a masthead, a comprehensive truth source that unpacked our shared software delivery process at the program level. The result of trying to address this need was the publication of a program-wide "Agility Handbook". 

**The Agility Handbook**

This new agility handbook addressed several needs:

1.  It's specified changes we need to make across all teams to facilitate interoperability and alignment.
2.  It documented specific things that we were doing there were institutional knowledge that would have been lost if certain vital people left.
3.  It included both of these in a short but comprehensive document that could be used in two ways:
    1.  As a central point of reference in discussion with existing team members
    2.  Then doesn't onboarding tool for new hires.

We invested a lot of mental effort on what to include, what not to include, and how to communicate it in the most concise way possible. We labored strenuously for simplicity. Now I have to admit when we released this document, I was one proud papa. My agility cohort, Rick Pollick, and I felt really good about the final product, so I did what anyone would do. I shared it with some old Scrum Master friends of mine, possibly looking for a little kudos. One response stuck out to me more than the others, and it was this: "Why not just use the scrum guide?"

No kudos, no accolades, no attaboys. Just a little "what are you trying to be so extra?" This question has rattled around in my brain for several months, and in the rest of this talk, I intend to answer it; and in addition to that, I'm going to lay out some reasons why you might want to compose your own agility handbook as well. After that, I’ll conclude with a few guidelines that might help you construct that guide. But first a word about taking out our own medicine. 

**Dogfooding Agile**

But before we get into the meat and potatoes, I want to try to deal with some potential prejudice so that the ideas presented are more likely to have receptive ground.

It's possible to have an anti-innovation attitude as an agilist. Maybe because a lot of what passes as customizations and Innovations actually contradict some fundamental tenants of the agile mindset and iterative approach. But we should be careful to not throw out the baby with the bathwater.

We have to be careful that in our attempt to champion the spirit of what we believe in, we don't become rigid, inflexible, or unteachable. We should always be innovating, experimenting, learning, growing, improving, and advancing the science and ideology of our craft. And this conference's very theme points to that. Change. 

**Reasons to write your own Agility Handbook**

1.  If you deviate from any point from the Scrum Guide, you can't use it as your manual \[show chart\]

Potential or common deviations:

1.  Pure kanban teams. They very likely won't have the same ceremonies as a team that's sprinting. 
2.  Component teams that provide critical infrastructure requirements to your feature teams and don't produce vertical slice features as their primary deliverables.

These exceptions are not outliers in fact, they are the vast majority of the norm as it's been documented that most teams you said mixed methods approach \[show chart\].

1.  The Scrum Guide is not specific to your organization.

There will be specific implementation details and pain points specific to your org's application of scrum. Possible examples could be…

1.  Release planning (Nexus?)
2.  Workflows (Kanban)
3.  Component teams and tribes (SAFe influence)
4.  The Prime Directive (Values) 

The Alternative

Now one possible alternative to doing this would be to have new folks read the Scrum Guide, Nexus, the Kanban guide for scrum teams, a few miscellaneous SAFe articles, and then some final material covering our specific implementation details that are either not covered by the previous works or contradicted by them. 

Two final thoughts before moving into our final section:

*   Our book is not yours.
*   These previous docs are great templates.

**Characteristics of a good Agility Manual**

1.  Actionable: As useful as a map. Comprehensive enough to be useful in onboarding.
2.  Concise: Short enough to read in one sitting (Concise with moderate commitment).
3.  Living + dynamic: In Source control, anyone can make a pull request and everyone can subscribe to changes. This produces a mechanism whereby the document evolves and changes through the natural review process and engineers are accustomed to.
4.  Endorsed: this means leadership is behind it and it's put its stamp on it and presented it to the organization as the dynamic blueprint for its software process.

Paper abstract:

Every organization’s software delivery process is going to be inevitably unique. It's important that that process is documented and codified in such a way that various teams independently and yet compatibly. We sought to accomplish this by writing our own Agility Manual. This really begs the question of why we didn’t just use the Scrum Guide and other standard guides available. This talk will discuss reasons why we did so and provide helpful guidelines for others considering doing the same. 

Learning outcomes:

*   Expanded view of the use and application of the Scrum Guide
*   Encouragement for greater boldness in experimentation
*   Advanced coordination methods for remote-first teams
*   An a la carte approach to studying auxiliary agile approaches
