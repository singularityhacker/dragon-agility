A central Concept in the agile thought space is the concept of a feedback loop in the primary benefit of the feedback loop is learning so instead of learning that you're wrong or right three to six months down the road you create smaller feedback loops good let you know whether you're right or wrong in days or weeks. Another prominent area where learning takes Center Stage is in the role of the agilest. The agilist or scrum master has no official Authority and yet a part of their job is to effect change. So how is this change take place if there is no authority to enact it? They do it through persuasive education. So rather than merely seeing this education is an unspoken feature of the agile system, the dragon agility group does elevate it 2 core principle that leads into a systematic strategy and approaches two organizational-wide change. So whereas other business agility transformation systems May emphasize specific practices or new roles, we emphasize the communication, understanding, and evaluation of new ideas and Concepts propagated throughout the organization. In this way, practices and effective roles are an organic by-product of individuals whose ideas have been changed and won over the agile delivery way. This learning-centered approach manifests at several levels and we'll examine them now.

## The Organizations Agile Working Group (AWG)

The first goal of an organization's agile working group is to educate itself. As servant leaders, Agilists are to be leading by example and engaging in continuous learning, then they can expect anyone else to do it either. This means advancing their knowledge of agile methods, the business in which they work, and general personal self-improvement. While the Dag aims to be an improvement in advancement on standard agile practices, we don't in the slightest deem education, familiarity, and certification, and existing agile methodologies a waste of time. In fact, it's our stated purpose to advance and add to the various ideas contained in this approach by increase familiarity with existing methods such that we keep and modify what works remove what doesn't. This includes familiarity in the following approaches and schools of thought:

1.  SAFe
2.  Scrum at Scale
3.  Kanban
4.  ITIL
5.  LESS

## The Organizations University of Learning

Having established the need for the AWG to be always learning and growing, the next logical step is for the rest of the program to do the same? But how is this established in a systematic way? Why is you saw in system-level design, the program is split along two axes. The first is feature teams that deliver user-facing features, while the other is tribes or communities of practice. As has already been discussed, these are comprised of specialists shared across all the feature teams. Now just as there are regular recurring highly structured sessions designed to facilitate the needs of the feature teams, so there are also regular highly structured sessions to facilitate the needs of the tribes. As the output of the team sessions is the movement of work through the workflow to user-facing features, so the output of the tribe sessions are captured learning sessions they can then be referenced to repurpose in the future that together comprise an organization's "University" of knowledge. Different members of a tribe volunteer to teach and lead these sessions while attendees get the benefit of progressing through various stages of familiarity and competency among their peers. These sessions can be scheduled in advance in organized in such a way to provide new additions to the organization or to the tribe ineffective and highly relevant course of study and achievement.

## The Future

In keeping with our value of tools and automation, there are routes to making this large-scale educational effort more effective and resilient. Firstly, it's now possible to programmatically generate video material from written documentation. This means that our emphasis on manual-driven practice and understanding can effortlessly lead to more easily digestible educational content. It's also now possible to programmatically generate tests from the same written content to evaluate learners' understanding of what was presented. Both of these ideas are captured in the concept of "automated education". Another technical feature that could be added to this is a badging system that qualifies both learner's and teachers' progression and contribution to the university. Something like completion, achievement, or graduation badges could be added to this system using something like an NFT that would bring gamification mechanics into the system.
